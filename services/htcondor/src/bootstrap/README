The htcondor JobMachineFeatures services package
contains both the software and the configuration templates
needed to add MJF features to a HTCondor pool.

This subdirectory contains the  code to configure the node.

There is only one file at this time:
*) create_hostdir.sh

It should be copied in some system area, e.g. /usr/local/sbin
run it once and also added to the boot sequence.

create_hostdir.sh
========================
This script parses the configuration files and creates
the directories and files that describe the host.

It autodetection is enabled (the default), it will fail
if some of the values cannot be determined.

There are two typical failure modes:
a) Cannot determine the HTCondor properties,
   e.g. if HTCondor is not properly installed
b) Cannot determine the HS06 value,
   e.g. if the CPU model is not listed in the mapfile
 
Please notice that successful completion is needed
for the package to work.
