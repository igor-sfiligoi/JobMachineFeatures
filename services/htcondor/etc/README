The htcondor JobMachineFeatures services package
contains both the software and the configuration templates
needed to add MJF features to a HTCondor pool.

This etc subdirectory contains the configuration templates
used by the module.

There are two files:
*) wlcg-mjf-htcondor.config
*) wlcg-mjf-hs06.map

Both should be copied into the /etc directory of all worker nodes,
after being properly customized.

The aim is to allow a site admin to use 
the same identical file on all the worker nodes,
but a site admin can choose to make node-by-node
config changes as well.

wlcg-mjf-htcondor.config
========================
This is the main config file.
There is generally no need to modify this,
unless you want to override autodetection.


wlcg-mjf-hs06.map
=================
This file is used to estimate the HS06 number,
based on the processor model number.
The file in the repository is just a template;
the site admin must populate it with the values
appropriate to the HW it is operating.
