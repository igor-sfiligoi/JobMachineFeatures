The htcondor JobMachineFeatures services package
contains both the software and the configuration templates
needed to add MJF features to a HTCondor pool.

The module has two parts:
*) src/ contains the code to be used by HTCondor
*) etc/ contains the configuration templates
          used by the code above

Here are summary instructions on how to use it:
0) get files from github
1) put etc/wlcg-mjf-htcondor.config into /etc
   on all worker nodes
   (no customizations should be needed)
2) create a customized version of etc/wlcg-mjf-hs06.map
   (possibly using the file in github as a starting point)
   and put it in /etc on all worker nodes
3) put src/bootstrap/create_hostdir.sh
   in some system area, e.g. /usr/local/sbin
   run it once
   and also add it to the boot sequence
4) put src/wrapper/set_job_env.source.sh
   in some system area, e.g. /usr/local/libexec
   and configure HTCondor to source it in 
   the USER_JOB_WRAPPER used by the system setup

See the README in each section for more details.
