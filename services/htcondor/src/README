The htcondor JobMachineFeatures services package
contains both the software and the configuration templates
needed to add MJF features to a HTCondor pool.

This src subdirectory contains the code to be used by HTCondor.

It contains 2 subdirectories:
*) bootstrap/ contains the code to configure the node
*) wrapper/   contains the code needed at each job startup

Here are summary instructions on how they are to be used:
0) properly configure the node config files
1) put bootstrap/create_hostdir.sh
   in some system area, e.g. /usr/local/sbin
   run it once
   and also add it to the boot sequence
2) put wrapper/set_job_env.source.sh
   in some system area, e.g. /usr/local/libexec
   and configure HTCondor to source it in 
   the USER_JOB_WRAPPER used by the system setup

See the README in each section for more details.
