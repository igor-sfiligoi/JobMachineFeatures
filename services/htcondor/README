The htcondor JobMachineFeatures services package
contains both the software and the configuration templates
needed to add MJF features to a HTCondor pool.

The module has two parts:
*) src/ contains the code to be used by HTCondor
*) etc/ contains the configuration templates
          used by the code above

See the README in each section on how to use the content.
