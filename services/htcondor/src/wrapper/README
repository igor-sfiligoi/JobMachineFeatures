The htcondor JobMachineFeatures services package
contains both the software and the configuration templates
needed to add MJF features to a HTCondor pool.

This subdirectory contains the code needed at each job startup.

There is only one file at this time:
*) set_job_env.source.sh

It should be copied in some system area, 
e.g. /usr/local/libexec
and sourced as part of the 
HTCondor's USER_JOB_WRAPPER bash-based script (not included).

set_job_env.source.sh
========================
This script parses the configuration files,
creates the necessary directories and files,
and sets the environment variables as per the
JobMachineFeatures specification, i.e.
MACHINEFEATURES, JOBFEATURES and JOBSTATUS 

More details can be found at
https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LCG/WMTEGEnvironmentVariables

If any problems are detected, the env variables will not be set.
